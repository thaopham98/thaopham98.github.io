            <h3>Student Clubs and Organizations</h3>
            <p>We have three active student clubs – Mathematics Club, Computer Science Club, and Engineering Club.</p>
            <p>The College of Sciences offers students a scientific education to meet the needs of the 21st century, allowing them to compete for a variety of careers in an increasingly complex and evolving world.</p>

            <h3>Student Clubs and Organizations</h3>
            <p>Our student clubs usually have activities on Friday afternoon at 1:00 at the room GH201. Here is the schedules of future and past events.</p>
            <a href="http://sciences-srv.aum.edu/~ywang/colloquia/departmentColloquia.htm">Schedule</a>
            <h4>Mathematics Club</h4>
            <p>Activities include math games, puzzles, discussions of mathematics related problems, etc. Club members form the core of the Math Jeopardy Team! The team usually attends the Southeastern Section of the MAA (Mathematical Association of America) conference and competition.</p>
            <h4><a href="http://aumcompsci.acm.org/">Computer Club</a></h4>
            <p>Activities include analyzing/studying codes, developing programming projects, etc. Club members are usually the core members of the team competing in the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Southeast USA Regional Intercollegiate Programming Contest. Our computer club is also a student chapter of ACM at AUM.</p>
            <h4>Engineering Club</h4>
            <p>Activities include robotics, radio control plane, etc. Some members are also members of the Math or Computer clubs. The club has an engineering lab. Students use the lab to perform experiments. The lab also houses a Biodiesel system. The system can convert waste cooking oil to biodiesel fuel. There is an annual engineering competition open to students registered in the “Introduction to Engineering” class. WindTurbine, electric motor bike, robotic arms, etc. are some past competition projects.</p>
            <h4>Montgomery City Math Circle (MC)^2</h4>
            <p>The first math circle in Greater Montgomery. The Circle is part of the National Association of Math Circle (www.mathcircles.org). The meetings are run and organized by local high school students supervised and sponsored by AUM Mathematics and Computer Science Department. One of the goals is to guide local middle schoolers to expand their mathematical knowledge outside of the classroom, explore the inner beauty of mathematics, and hone their academic capabilities to excel both in school and competition. This is not a math tutorial service though. For those who want to know about (MC)^2, please explore the circle page www.montgomerycitymathcircle.weebly.com or contact Dr. Enoch Lee.</p>
